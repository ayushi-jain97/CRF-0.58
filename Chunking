# Chunking

Chunking refers to dividing a text into syntactically correlated parts of words.
For example, the sentence “He reckons the current account deficit will narrow to only # 1.8 billion in September.” 
can be divided as follows:

B-NP He
B-VP reckons
B-NP the
I-NP current
I-NP account
I-NP deficit
B-VP will
I-VP narrow
B-PP to
B-NP only
I-NP #
I-NP 1.8
I-NP billion
B-PP in
B-NP September
O    .

The output is in IOB format where B refers to Beginning of a phrase, I is inside and O is for outside the phrase.

# Creating and Testing a Chunker

```python
crf_learn template train.txt model
crf_test -m model test.txt > output.txt
```
## Template file for chunking is available.
